# Predicting Sepsis Using An EnsembleOf Gated Recurrent Units And Long Short Term Memory Models

Project Tilburg University

This is private repository for my thesis project. It containts the Jupyter Notebook's which were used for the project. These contain the data visualizations, the pre-processing of the data, the machine learning models and their results.

## Data
The data is originally from the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 by Reyna  et  al. (2019). 

## Notebooks

There are a total of 8 notebooks in this repository which can be categorised in two sections:

#### Data Visualization and Preprocesing
```bash
Sepsis Data Analysis.ipynb

Sepsis Preprocessing - Undersampling and Padding.ipynb
Sepsis Preprocessing - Missing Values.ipynb
```

#### Training models and Evaluating
```bash
Final_LSTM.ipynb
Final_GRU.ipynb

Ensembling_LSTM.ipynb
Ensembling_GRU.ipynb
Ensembling_GRU_LSTM.ipynb
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
